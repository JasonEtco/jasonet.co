title: Path to Staff Engineer
spoiler: I want to talk about my career progression from intern to staff engineer

I'm not sure why I'm writing this, because it'll only make me feel more like an imposter. But I was recently (~2 months ago) promoted to Staff Software Engineer at GitHub, which to me is a real accomplishment that I'm very proud of. It's a recognition of outsized impact, and trust that I can and will to great work and help the company/product be even better.

The reason I'm not sure I have any business writing this (in Nov. 2022) is that 5 years ago, I was an intern at GitHub, in the summer of 2017. In my last year of University, I continued my relationship there into a contracting role, then full time for the last 3 months of my last semester. Doing the math there, you can pretty quickly tell that I haven't been a professional software engineer for that long... and yet, here I am, a Staff Engineer.

Imposter syndrome is a thing - if I didn't feel it, there'd be something very very wrong with my ego. But I wanted to share the details of my career so far so that folks in their first internship, or looking to grow as a Software Engineer II or III, or even Senior+ can see that it's possible to grow quickly. To be clear: this isn't a story of how to trick people into thinking you're at a higher level - it's _my_ story of how _I_ found opportunities, worked my ass off for them, and built up my skills in the process.

## Pre-GitHub

I'll keep this bit short - I studied Graphic Design, and learned to code as a hobby. It was a fun, productive way to augment my design work. I was lucky to have a "coding buddy" in [@matchai](https://github.com/matchai), and we learned a lot by investigating stuff together, and separately while comparing notes. I don't think either of us really intended it to be our futures, which made it all the more fun - it was low-stress, and just a cool fun hobby to play around with.

In University, I did whatever I could to get my toes wet with design and development. In Toronto, there's a plethora of startups looking for cheap contract/freelance work. I did some of that, then worked a summer job with [Spently](https://spently.com). It was a tiny company of 4 people, of which I was the fifth. I was the only one with design and front-end development knowledge, and I somehow convinced them that I was good enough to be left alone to build stuff with a purpose. I think that was the first time I felt like I was a "real" developer, and it was a great feeling. It was so fun to come into work everyday, talk about the work I was doing (a React-based drag-and-drop email template builder) and get feedback from the team. Startups aren't for everyone, but boy golly did I learn a lot by just having a goal and motivation to complete it.

## GitHub Internship

I was lucky enough to get an internship at GitHub in the summer of 2017. People ask me how did I possibly get in - there's not special story, I was putzing around on GitHub, spotted the careers section and said "ooh, I could use an internship!" and applied. Many, many interviews later, I joined the Training team as a "Graphic Designer for Training". They were particularly happy with my experience mentoring workshops (I'd been doing that for a few years at that point), and so accepted me to work on design assets for their training content.

On the first day, my manager at the time said one of the most impactful sentences of my entire career:

> We have a project for you, but we want you to pick something that you think is impactful, that you can learn from, and that you can be proud of.

To someone who got into this magical devtools company, that level of freedom was mind-blowing. Of course, I did have to work on the core thing I was asked to do - but I made a case for a redesign of the GitHub Professional Services marketing site. It wasn't a big deal tech-wise, just a statically generated Jekyll site. But _I_ was in charge - I worked on the design, I collaborated with others on the content, and I wrote all the code for it. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot about how to work with a team, and how to work with a team that's distributed across the world. I learned about the structure of the organization, the ways we talk to customers, the features that were most exciting or marketable at the time. Being in the Sales division (not Engineering or Design), I made relationships with Sales-people, who are _so interesting_ to talk to. I learned about the business side of things, and how to talk about the product in a way that's meaningful to customers.

I think that experience gave me a different perspective from many engineers. It's easy to focus on _your_ work, doing what you can to deliver the best engineering work possible. But **that limits your impact** - a theme you'll see throughout my story.

The other important thing I did during my internship was doing as much cross-team work as possible. When I spotted a call for a volunteer on anything even remotely applicable to me, I raised my hand. I worked really hard to be able to do it all - I got to the office early and stayed at the office late. But I knew I had 3 months to absorb everything I could, and I wasn't going to waste a second.

## Probot

That attitude led me to working on an open source project called [Probot](https://probot.github.io). Probot is a framework for building GitHub Apps, which are a way to extend GitHub's functionality. Working with some wonderful folks on it, I learned and learned and learned, by watching them and asking questions. At that point, I was pretty confident in my front-end development skills and just starting to get into the Node.js world. Seeing their patterns for testing, and how they worked with the GitHub API, and how they structured their code, was a great learning experience. Probot also wasn't a super complicated piece of technology. It was (and still is) a fantastically helpful framework, but the core of it isn't actually that complicated - which made it a great learning project for me.

## GitHub Contracting/Full Time

After my internship, I was offered a contract position to work on a project that, at least to my eye, really should be built on Probot. It was eventually called GitHub Learning Lab, an experience for learning to use GitHub and related technologies that took place within a GitHub repository. It dealt a lot with webhooks, REST API requests and GitHub App installations - and so my experience with Probot, and my relationship with the Training team that was looking to build this tool, made me an immediate fit for the project.

Reflecting there: holy shit was I lucky to have gotten involved with Probot (and grateful to @bkeepers for mentoring me during that time). Knowing what I know now about GitHub's org structure, there's no way I would have been able to land a full time job anywhere else in the company, and if I hadn't gotten involved with Probot, I wouldn't have been able to make a case for working on Learning Lab.

## Learning Lab

Similar to my time at startups, my time working on Learning Lab was very independant. That's unusual at a big company, but we were operating sort of like a startup within GitHub, making progress on our project in our own little corner. I was the only engineer on it for about a year, making slow but steady progress. Eventually, we hired 2 more engineers - and being the only engineer around, I was heavily involved in the hiring process. Again, a nonsensical opportunity that I gave my all to learn from. A couple of months later, I was promoted to be the tech lead for the team - we didn't have a traditional engineering manager, so I was to be the technical go-to. This was a reflection of the work I was already doing, both by being the most tenured person on the project and because of my (at that point) intimate knowledge of Learning Lab's codebase and the nuances of GitHub's API.

This was my first time "leading" engineers. I'm grateful that we hired some wonderful folks who made that responsibility pretty easy - but it meant that I shifted my mindset incrementally more towards setting us all up for success, instead of just going and doing everything. Opening issues, researching ideas, being the go-to for people to talk to our team about engineering-related things. I was doing all of that already, again because I had the most context and historical knowledge, the most relationships outside of our team.

## A couple of re-orgs

All companies have 'em. I was re-orged a few times, first into a team and project that I just wasn't happy with. I really tried to like it, but after about 6 months (in hindsight, that was too long) I started trying to switch teams. I still loved GitHub, I just wasn't growing or interested in the work we were doing.

This is now about 3 years into my full-time career at GitHub; so I knew the company pretty well, I had friends in lots of places in various parts of the org, so I knew what teams and feature areas were interesting to me. Unfortunately, at that point I hadn't worked a ton with Ruby - which, within GitHub, is pretty necessary. I got by with my JavaScript knowledge for a long time, but when I started talking to teams to see if I could join them, Ruby just kept coming up.
